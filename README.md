Describe your solution here.


implemented the app using a clean MVVM architecture with Hilt for dependency injection. 
The Repository layer (AudioRepositoryImpl) is responsible for loading audio files through the Android file picker,
stripping the WAV header if present, and exposing the raw audio data together with the file name. 
The Service layer (AudioPlayerServiceImpl) wraps MediaPlayer and provides playback controls (prepare, play, pause, seek, release)
along with position updates and completion callbacks.

The ViewModel (WaveformViewModel) coordinates between the repository, player service, and UI.
It exposes a WaveformUiState that holds the current playback state (loading, error, file name, duration, position, playing/paused). 
It also formats time into mm:ss, handles errors gracefully, and updates the UI reactively.

On the UI side, the main activity observes the ViewModel and updates controls like play/pause, 
seek bar, file name, and time indicators. The custom Waveform view renders the audio data efficiently by grouping samples 
into pixel “bins” and drawing a vertical line between min and max values per bin. 
This reduces rendering from tens of thousands of points per second to just one line per pixel,
keeping performance smooth even for larger files.

Overall, this architecture separates concerns cleanly:

Repository → file loading

Service → playback

ViewModel → state & logic

UI → rendering & interaction

This makes the code easier to maintain, test, and extend.


To ensure correctness and reliability, I added unit tests, UI tests, and integration tests:

Repository tests validate that audio files are read correctly, the WAV header is skipped when present,
filenames are extracted properly (including edge cases with empty cursors), and failures are reported consistently.

Service tests mock MediaPlayer and check that playback controls (prepare, play, pause, seek, release) work as expected, 
that position updates are triggered at the right intervals, and that completion callbacks reset state properly.

ViewModel tests verify the state transitions of WaveformUiState during file loading, error handling, 
play/pause toggling, and seek operations. They also check that position and completion events from the service update the state correctly.

UI and integration tests (using Espresso with Hilt test bindings) cover the overall user flow: 
picking a file, enabling playback controls, interacting with the waveform view, updating timeline labels,
toggling playback, and ensuring resources are released on lifecycle changes.

Together, these tests give confidence that each layer works in isolation and that the entire flow — from
loading a file to rendering and playback — behaves correctly for both success and error scenarios.
